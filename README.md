# Surfs_up

## Project Overview
In the Surfs Up project, we are looking at the possibility of opening a surf and ice cream shop on the Hawaiian island of Oahu. To convience potential investors of an ice cream and surf shop start up, we look at the weather patterns on the island. In order to convince them, we use a weather database in a .sqlite format. We also look at the descriptive statistics of the weather of the months in question to determine the sustainability of this shop year-round. We also are looking at the best site on the island based on the location of weather stations. With all these factored in, we can determine if it is possible to open a shop and the best place to open shop at.

## Results

* 1. The average temperature in the month of June is 75° while the average temperature in the month of December is 71°
* 2. The overall low in temperature observed in June was 64° while the overall low in December was 56°
* 3. The overall high in temperature observed in June was 85° while the overall high in December was 83°

## Summary
After looking at the results, it is pretty clear that the island does not have a big shift in temperature from June to December. With an average temperature being four degrees off, we can tell the investors that this start up can be sustainable year round. With that being said, there are a few queries that probably needs to be done in order to find the best suitable spot to open the first shop and potentially other on the island.

Two additional queries to perform to gather more weather data for June and December would be elevation on where the shop would and distance of to the beach. The reason for the elevation query is to determine if being at a higher elevation reduces precipitation and temperature enough to bring in more customers. The location to the beach query is to see if customers would prefer to buy surf board and be on the beach shortly thereafter.
